# Tamagotchi

## Description
The purpose of this project was to practice modular development and utilize SASS to style the app without the use of Bootstrap.

Each of the quadrants contains buttons the either increase or descrease the score within the corresponding quadrant. Each of those scores is then collected and an average score is printed above the app with a progress bar that updates upon each button click.
