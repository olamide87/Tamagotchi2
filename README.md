## Tamagotchi2

# Description
This project is used to show the progression of javascript modules paired with Sass styling. This project is also our first introduction to using webpack. It is designed to be an application that mimics the Tamagotchi toy. Not quite on par with the Tamagotchi toy, this application allows for interactive buttons in four catagories: Eat, Play, Fight, and Sleep. These buttons change the score of each catagory in positive or negative ways depending on the button clicked.

# Feature List
* Four interactive catagories
* Buttons used to change catagory score
* Sass styling
